# ** Communication **

## Validation, Collaboration and Learning

These are some conduct recommendations that should be followed, as to mantain an healthy workplace culture.

### ** It is desirable that the validation processes are objective and automated **

* do the builds pass or not?
* was the process completed or not?
* main validation with subjective component:
 * is the solution easily comprehensible for the other team members?

### ** The code-review process must be one of seeking help **

* “how can I improve this solution? Is there an obvious, safer and/or efficient way of solving this problem? Which is it?”
* “will this modification have consequences that are not being properly anticipated?”
* “is this consistent with other areas of the project?”

### ** Learning **

* become aware of other ways of tackling a problem
* disseminate technical and functional knowledge, be it specific or generic

## The challenges of written language

### ** Formality vs. Informality **

* there are times in which one must be serious, formal and precise and there are other times, as well, in which one can be expansive and friendly
* what is written in an issue or in a pull request, for example, must exhibit a formal posture
* neither Jira nor BitBucket are places for comedy, underlying opinions or personal attacks; irony, ellipsis or vague answers should not be used

### ** Affirmations vs. Opinions **

* almost everything written in a code-review or specification is subjective and it must be presented as such

### ** Avoid conflicts without being passive **

* misunderstandings have shared responsabilities
* receptivity is key when arguing with someone with a different opinion
* don't use "you" and "I" but use instead “the X approach has the Y advantage”
* it does not should come to “my solution vs. your solution” but instead try to aim for a better “our solution”
* defend your positions with structured arguments
* if possible, follow a critique of something that you think is wrong with a clear suggestion of improvement
* everytime a written discussion gets difficult, change the conversation channel to something less formal, like Slack or even in person, in portuguese, and record the conclusions in the issue or pull request
* there are no stupid solutions, nor there are stupid persons in our team; there are only solutions that are more easily perceivable to some of us then to others
