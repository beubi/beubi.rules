# ** Multiple Issues **

These are the guidelines followed by the company regarding the approach used when dealing with multiple issues.

## Divide and Conquer

### ** If a problem can be separated in multiple, smaller problems, usually it's worth it **

* the cost of fractioning an issue/branch/pull request is small, when compared with the benefits of adressing more atomic problems:
 * code reviewing takes less time
 * there is a smaller chance of missing mistakes
 * partial solutions/advantages are available sooner

### ** There are diferent types of division **
* isolate part of a pull request to create a smaller one
* totally separate complementary but independent scopes
* separate the main portion from the complementary one

### ** Reflect every modification in the relationships and acceptance criteria of the issues **

## Priorities

### ** Blocking questions **

* you should interrupt immediately what you are doing when:
 * there's a direct mention to you in the team chat
 * a blocking issue is directly assigned to you
 * there's a blocking issue or urgent situation that no one is adressing yet
 * opening an issue to introduce new improvements/necessities

### ** Priority questions **

* you should adress these questions as soon as possible when:
 * there's a mention to you in a pull-request or e-mail
 * there are conflicts to fix in one of your pull requests (PR)
 * there are builds, of which you are the author, that are failing
 * keep tabs on the code review of our PRs
 * add details to issues previously opened by you
 * proceeding with the development of issues already started by you but that are not yet finished

### ** Between issues, the main factor of distinction is their own priority **

* it's more relevant to help the team advance on a high priority issue (by doing code review, discussing a better approach, etc) than starting the development of a low priority one!

### ** Criteria used to differentiate between issues with the same priority **

* doing code review of open pull requests
* participate in the discussion and introducing details in issues with status "To Do"
* start developing issues that have been assigned to me
* doing self-assign of an issue
