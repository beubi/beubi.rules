# ** 2. Ready For Work **

### ** When dealing with unassigned issues, this are the principles that MUST be followed: **

* manual transitions are done only after it's stablished that the issue has the necessary details needed to its execution
* for issues with funcional impact, the transition needs the approval of the Project Manager (PM)
* either the PM or someone who wants to adress the issue can set the status as "Ready For Work"
* ideally, the estimated amount of time needed to complete the issue should be included
