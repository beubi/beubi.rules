# ** 5. Functional Review **

### ** When an issue gets to the stage of funtional review, these are the guidelines that MUST be followed: **

* the assignee must be the Project Manager (PM)
* the PM verifies on QEM the functional impact of QEM
* code-tasks must be used for modifications that are certain to not have any negative functional impact and, with that, the PM can approve the issues swiftly
* it is the PM that approves or merge pull-requests
